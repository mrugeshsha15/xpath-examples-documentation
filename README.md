XPath Examples Documentation
Overview
This README provides detailed documentation on using XPath expressions for navigating XML documents. It covers various axes relationships and dynamic element selection techniques using XPath.

Table of Contents

XPath Axes: Preceding and Following
XPath Axes: Ancestor and Descendant Relationship
XPath Axes: Parent and Child Relation
Dynamic Elements: Elements with Dynamic Property-Values and/or Text

XPath Axes: Preceding and Following
These XPath expressions allow traversal of nodes relative to a specified reference node (Node1) based on their positional relationship (preceding or following) within the document structure.

Syntax Examples
//Node1/preceding::*
//Node1/preceding-sibling::*
//Node1/following::*
//Node1/following-sibling::*
XPath Axes: Ancestor and Descendant Relationship
These expressions enable traversal between ancestor and descendant nodes relative to the reference node (Node1) within the XML document hierarchy.

Syntax Examples
//Node1/ancestor::*
//Node1/descendant::*
XPath Axes: Parent and Child Relation
These expressions facilitate navigation between parent and child nodes relative to the specified reference node (Node1) within the XML document structure.

Syntax Examples
//Node1/child::*
//Node1/parent::*

Dynamic Elements: Elements with Dynamic Property-Values and/or Text
These expressions demonstrate dynamic element selection criteria utilizing various operators such as 'and', 'or', 'contains', and 'starts-with' to match elements based on their attributes and text content.

Syntax Examples

Using 'and' Operator

//TagName[@Att1='Value1' and @Att2='Value2']
//TagName[@Att='Value' and Text()='Value']
Using 'or' Operator

//TagName[@Att1='Value1' or @Att2='Value2']
//TagName[@Att='Value' or Text()='Value']
Using 'contains'

//TagName[contains(@Att,'Partial Value')]
//TagName[contains(text(),'Partial Value')]
Using 'starts-with'

//TagName[starts-with(@Att,'Starting Value')]
//TagName[starts-with(text(),'Starting Value')]
Hybrid

//TagName[contains(@Att1,'Partial Value') and starts-with(text(),'Starting Value')]
//TagName[@Att1='Value' or starts-with(@Att2,'Starting Value')]
//*[@Att='Value']

Usage
This documentation serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding and utilizing XPath expressions effectively in XML document processing. It can be used by developers, testers, and individuals working with XML documents to enhance their XPath querying skills.
